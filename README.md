# NLP Projects Repository

Welcome to the NLP Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that I have worked on. Each project is designed to showcase different aspects of NLP, ranging from text preprocessing to advanced machine learning models.

## Project List

## SPAM MESSAGE CLASSIFICATION 
Description: 
The "Spam Message Classification" project is a natural language processing (NLP) project focused on building a machine learning model to classify messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). Spam messages are unwanted and often contain unsolicited content, while ham messages are legitimate and desired communications. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between the two, helping to filter out unwanted messages.

Key components of the project include:

Data Exploration: Analyzing and understanding the characteristics of the dataset containing both spam and ham messages.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis, including tasks such as lowercasing, removing special characters, and tokenization.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as word frequencies or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values.

Model Building: Employing machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or other classifiers, to create a predictive model for spam classification.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a test dataset.

Technologies Used
The project leverages the following technologies and libraries:

Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation of the project.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library providing tools for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for natural language processing, used for text preprocessing tasks such as stopwords removal.

Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library used for handling and exploring the dataset.

Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive notebooks used for coding, data visualization, and documentation.

Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.

The combination of these technologies facilitates the development of a robust spam message classification model, enabling the identification and filtering of unwanted messages from legitimate ones.

## RESTAURANT REVIEW PREDICTION
Description: 
The "Restaurant Review Prediction" project focuses on the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict and analyze sentiments in restaurant reviews. The primary objective is to develop a model capable of classifying reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiments expressed by customers. This project aids restaurant owners and managers in understanding customer feedback and improving overall customer satisfaction.

Key components of the project include:

Data Collection: Gathering a dataset of restaurant reviews, including information about the restaurant, the reviewer, and the text of the review.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the textual data, including tasks such as lowercasing, removing stopwords, and handling special characters.

Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or deep learning models, to predict the sentiment polarity of each review.

Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as word embeddings or TF-IDF values, to represent the reviews in a format suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training: Training a predictive model on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and associations between review features and sentiments.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a test dataset.

Technologies Used
The project leverages a variety of technologies and libraries:

Python: The primary programming language used for implementation.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library providing tools for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for natural language processing, used for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.

Word Embeddings: Pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to capture semantic relationships between words in the reviews.

Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive notebooks used for coding, data exploration, and documentation.

Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library for handling structured data.

Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.

This project aims to provide insights into the sentiments expressed in restaurant reviews, helping restaurant owners and managers make informed decisions to enhance customer experiences.
